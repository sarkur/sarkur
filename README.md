- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sarkur I'm a Researcher in population genetics/genomics at Sockholm University in the Laikre lab.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in population genetics and population genomics in salmonid fishes. My current research focuses on tracking temporal shifts in genomic variation (neutral and potentially adaptive) across microevolutionary time in natural populations.
